This is my implement for Attack Lab, whose goal is to learn how to use buffer overflow and return-oriented programming (ROP) to attack a program.

To test:
```
unix> make
```

The CS:APP Attack Lab
***********************

This file contains materials for one instance of the attacklab.

Files:

    ctarget

Linux binary with code-injection vulnerability.  To be used for phases
1-3 of the assignment.

    rtarget

Linux binary with return-oriented programming vulnerability.  To be
used for phases 4-5 of the assignment.

     cookie.txt

Text file containing 4-byte signature required for this lab instance.

     farm.c

Source code for gadget farm present in this instance of rtarget.  You
can compile (use flag -Og) and disassemble it to look for gadgets.

     hex2raw

Utility program to generate byte sequences.  See documentation in lab
handout.
