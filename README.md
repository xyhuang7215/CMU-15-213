# CMU 15-213

This repo is my implementation of [CS:APP](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/home.html) lab assignments, which is also the teaching material for CMU 15-213 Introduction to Computer Systems. 
Original write-ups and self-study handouts can be got from [here](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/labs.html), and I've given some instructions and notes (ongoing) in each lab. 
Feel free if you want to discuss or create a pull request.
